Description: interactions provides functions for classifying gene interaction profiles
             into mathematically and biologically defined interaction modes and classes,
             extending the homogenous classes of positive and negative synergies into
             heterogenous classes comprised of defined interaction modes. This package
             currently supports transformation of RNA-seq data (expected counts) for classification.
             limma and edgeR are used extensively for differential expression analysis. topGO is used
             for gene set enrichment for gene ontology.
